            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:180343:3"/>Parliament, reſtored the Church to it's ancient and right Government by Archbiſhops and Biſhops, and hath redintigrated the eſtate of Biſhops to the exerciſe of their Epiſcopal Function, and to all the Priviledges, Dignities, Juriſdictions, and Poſſeſſions due and formerly belonging thereunto. And in further order to the ſettlement of the Church, and bringing the Miniſters to a due acknowledgment of, and complyance with, the Government thereof thus eſtabliſhed by Law. His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> with advice foreſaid, hath alſo Statute and Ordained, That all theſe Miniſters, who entred to the Cure of any Paroch without Right or Preſentations from the lawful Patron, in and ſince the year, one thouſand ſix hundred and fourty nine, and ſhould not, betwixt and the twentieth of <hi>September</hi> laſt, obtain Preſentations from their ſeveral Patrons, and Collation from the Biſhop of the Dioceſs where they lived, ſhould have no right to the uplifting the Rents of any Benefice or Stipend for the year, one thouſand ſix hundred and ſixty two, but that their Places, Benefices and Kirks ſhould be, <hi>ipſo jure,</hi> vacand: And that whatever Miniſters ſhould, without a lawfull excuſe to be admitted by their ordinary, abſent themſelves from the dioceſian Aſſembly, or who ſhould not concur in all the Acts of the Church-diſcipline, as they ſhould be thereunto required by the Archbiſhop or Biſhop of the Dioceſs, ſhould be for the firſt fault ſuſpended from their Office and Benefice till the next dioceſian Meeting; and if they amend not, ſhould be deprived, and the Church and Benefice to be provided as in other caſes of vacancies. And the King's <hi>Majeſty,</hi> having reſolved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and maintain the Church in the preſent State and Government thereof by Archbiſhops and Biſhops, and others bearing office there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and not to endure nor give way or connivance to any variation therein in the leaſt. Doth therefore, with advice and conſent of His Eſtates conveened in this third Seſſion of His Parliament, Ratifie and Approve the afore-mentioned Acts and Laws made in the two former Seſsions of Parliament, in order to the ſetling of Epiſcopal Dignity, Juriſdiction and Authority within this Kingdom; and Ordains them to ſtand in full force as publick Laws of the Kingdom, and to be put to further execution in all points conform to the tenor thereof. And in purſuance of His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Royal reſolution herein, His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> with advice aforeſaid, doth recommend to the Lords of His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Privy Council, to take ſpeedy and effectual courſe, that theſe Acts receive ready and due obedience from all His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Subjects; And for that end, that they call before them all ſuch Miniſters, who, having entred in or ſince the year one thouſand ſix hundred and fourty nine, and have not as yet obtained Preſentations and Collations, as aforeſaid, yet dared to preach in contempt of the Law, and to puniſh them as ſeditious perſons and contemners of the Royal Authority. As alſo, that they be carefull, that ſuch Miniſters, who keep not the dioceſian Meetings, and concur not with the Biſhops in the Acts of Church-diſcipline, being for the ſame ſuſpended or deprived, as ſaid is, be accordingly, after deprivation, removed from their Benefices, Glebs and manſes; and if any of them ſhall notwithſtanding offer to retain the poſſeſſion of their Benefices or Manſes, that they take preſent
